/**
 * Fight!
 * ------
 * Description
 * Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what weâ€™ve learned in the previous stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe
 * that two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw,
 * or one of the players wins).
 * The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.
 * ------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, you should write a program that:
 * 1. Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
 * 2. Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates,
 *    analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
 * 3. Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
 * You need to output the final result at the end of the game. Good luck!
