# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)

## Project Details
> * **Level**: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Medium | **Time**: ðŸ•’ ~11 hours
> * **Course**: [Introduction to Java](https://hyperskill.org/courses/8-introduction-to-java)
> * **Project**: [Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48?track=8)
> * **Description**: After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex 
program from scratch, using methods, nested lists, list comprehension, handling errors, and processing user input.

## About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and 
Os.  A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best 
strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

* Stage 1/5: Welcome to the battlefield!
  * To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. Youâ€™ll write a serious multi-line 
    program using a lot of prints.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Introduction to Java
    * Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
    * Writing first program
    * Printing data
    * Types and variables
    * Comments
    * Reading user's input with Scanner
    * Coding style conventions
    * Naming variables
    * Arithmetic operations
    * Integer types and operations
    * Data types and their sizes
    * Type casting
* Stage 2/5: The user is the gamemaster
  * Now itâ€™s time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. Youâ€™ll learn to address 
    specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Increment and decrement
    * Calling methods
    * Primitive and reference types
    * Array
    * Characters
    * String
* Stage 3/5: What's up on the field?
  * Now weâ€™re going to write a fully-functioning multi-line program that responds to the userâ€™s actions and analyzes the 
    state of the field. Not only will it tell you who is winning, but it will also determine if the situation on a given 
    field is theoretically possible!
  * Stage Topics:
    * Floating-point types
    * Boolean type and operations. True and false
    * Comparing values. Relational operators
    * Conditional statement
    * One-line condition with ternary operator
    * While and do-while loops
    * For loop
    * Break and continue. Branching
    * Iterating over arrays
    * Multidimensional array
    * IntelliJ IDEA
    * IntelliJ IDEA basics
    * JetBrains Academy plugin
* Stage 4/5: First move!
  * Tic-tac-toe is not all about analysis â€“ a game is meant to be played! Write a program that can change the state of 
    the field, as your first real step toward a fully-functioning game application!
  * Stage Topics:
    * Write, compile, and run
    * Errors in programs
* Stage 5/5: Fight!
  * Finally! Thanks to this app, you can always challenge a friend to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe!
  * Stage Topics:
    * Multiple conditions: switch
